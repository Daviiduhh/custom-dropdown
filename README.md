# Custom Dropdown Menu

This project is a custom dropdown menu built as part of a challenge from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh). The dropdown allows users to select an item from a list with three distinct states: a default state with placeholder text, an open state displaying all options, and a selected state that highlights the chosen item.

You can view the live project here: [Custom Dropdown Menu](https://custom-dropdown-daviiduhh.netlify.app/).

## Features

- **Default State**: Displays placeholder text until an item is selected.
- **Open State**: Shows all available options when clicked.
- **Selected State**: Highlights the selected item and closes the dropdown.
- **Smooth Transitions**: The dropdown opens and closes smoothly with visual feedback.
